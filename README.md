# PC110-Mainboard-Schematic
Figuring out the schematic of PC110's mainboard

would like to do the followings:

1- Disassemble all the components from a motherboard and take a high res scan.

2- Sand every layer step-by-step and perform a high res scan.

3- Trace back each layer via KiCad and recreate the board

3- Identify the components (at least the standard ones) and represent the mysterious ones (ASIC like the CPU, Chips, Bowman, etc...) as blocks with pins.

4- Put together a schematic based a net list of traces in a software like Altium.

Stretch Goals:

1- Make a replacement PCB where you can have most of generic components already installed and try to migrate the ones that are specific to the new PCB.

2- Make a modernized version of the motherboard with a Vortex86 to be a drop in replacement with all* the features preserved or just modernize certain parts of the motherboard to newer stuff.
